## To do Additional Suggestions from resubmission

#### reduce load

- [ ] Implement recyclerview (viewholder pattern) to reduce findviewbyid calls
- [ ] remove uneccessary comments

#### data persistance - restore state

- [ ] store adapter data on rotation using onSaveInstanceState
- [ ] restore in oncreate or onRestoreInstanceState

#### ui problem 

- [ ] android:adjustViewBounds="true" correction for lower sdk levels
